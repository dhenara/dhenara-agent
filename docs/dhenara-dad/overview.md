# Dhenara Agent DSL : Coordination Service Overview

## Introduction

Dhenara Agent DSL is the central coordination service for the Dhenara Agent Platform, providing a robust framework for building, managing, and orchestrating AI agents. Built on top of the core `dhenara` package, which simplifies LLM API calls across providers, Dhenara Agent DSL enables the creation of complex, multi-agent systems using a programming language-like approach called DAD (Dhenara Agent DSL).

## Core Concepts

Dhenara Agent DSL is architected around several key concepts:

### 1. Domain-Specific Language (DAD)

Dhenara Agent DSL (DAD) is a Python-based domain-specific language that allows developers to define agent behaviors in a declarative way. DAD provides intuitive abstractions that make it easy to create complex agent behaviors without dealing with the underlying complexities of LLM API calls, execution flows, and state management.

### 2. Hierarchical Component Model

The system uses a hierarchical component model that allows for composition and reuse:

- **Nodes**: Atomic execution units that perform specific functions (e.g., making an LLM API call, analyzing a folder, performing file operations)
- **Flows**: Collections of nodes with execution logic, supporting sequential execution, conditionals, and loops
- **Agents**: Higher-level abstractions that can contain flows and other agents, representing complete functional units

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

An event system enables loose coupling between components, allowing agents to react to events, request inputs, and communicate with each other without tight coupling.

### 4. Execution Context Management

A sophisticated context management system tracks execution state, provides hierarchical variable scoping, and enables components to access outputs from earlier executions.

### 5. Template Engine

A powerful template engine supports variable substitution, expressions, and hierarchical references, making it easy to build dynamic prompts and process responses.
