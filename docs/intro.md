# Dhenara: AI Agent Management Platform

## Introduction

Dhenara is an innovative platform that enables developers to create and manage AI agents with minimal effort. Using just 20 lines of JSON, you can define sophisticated AI agents and deploy them to production through simple API calls. The platform supports not just individual agents but also teams of agents and complex hierarchical structures, enabling coordinated execution of complex tasks similar to human teams.

## Key Features

- **Quick Setup**: Create production-ready AI agents in minutes
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for standalone agents, agent teams, and hierarchical structures
- **Simple Integration**: Easy-to-use API endpoints for seamless integration
- **Production Ready**: Built for scalability and reliability

## Dhenara Agent Definition (DAD) Architecture

The DAD Architecture is our open-source framework for defining:

- Individual AI agents
- Synchronized agent teams
- Hierarchical team structures

This architecture provides a standardized way to describe agent behaviors, interactions, and workflows using simple JSON structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Resource Setup** (Optional)

   - Required only if using custom resources
   - Supports custom AI models
   - Configurable RAG endpoints

2. **API Authentication**

   - Obtain API key from Dhenara platform
   - Set up authentication in your environment

3. **SDK Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install dhenara
   ```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define Your Flow**

   - Create flow definition using DAD architecture
   - Configure agent behaviors and interactions
   - Define team structures if needed

2. **Create Run Endpoint**

   - Set up execution endpoint
   - Configure runtime parameters
   - Establish connection settings

3. **Integration**
   - Implement API calls in your application
   - Handle responses and callbacks
   - Monitor agent execution if needed
